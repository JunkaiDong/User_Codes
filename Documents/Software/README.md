# Installing Software Yourself

We have high-performance, scientific computing applications installed and available through our [software module system](https://docs.rc.fas.harvard.edu/kb/modules-intro/). These include compilers, licensed software, and commonly used libraries.

If you are looking to use a "bleeding edge" version of software or something specific only to your lab, you can install applications yourself in your home directory, any other space to which you can write, or a shared lab directory. Writing and installing your own software may be part of your research, too. Below you will find several approaches to compiling and installing personal software on the cluster. If you are having problems during your installation, submit a [help request on the RC Portal](https://portal.rc.fas.harvard.edu/rcrt/submit_ticket) or stop by [Office Hours](https://www.rc.fas.harvard.edu/training/office-hours/).
