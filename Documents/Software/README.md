# Installing Software Yourself

We have hundreds of high-performance, scientific computing applications installed and available through our [software module system](https://docs.rc.fas.harvard.edu/kb/modules-intro/). These include, compilers, interpreters, math libraries, I/O libraries, and tools for data analysis, visualization, computational biology, chemistry, and science and engineering domains.

If there is a software package that you would like to use, that is commonly used by your scientific domain, and is not available on the cluster, we encourage you to request that we install it as a module by submitting a [help request on the RC Portal](https://portal.rc.fas.harvard.edu/rcrt/submit_ticket). We want the cluster to be as immediately usable as possible for all users, and having all the common applications available is part of that.

If you are looking to use a "bleeding edge" version of software or something specific only to your lab, you can install applications yourself in your home directory, any other space to which you can write, or a shared lab directory. Writing and installing your own software may be part of your research, too. Below you will find several approaches to compiling and installing personal software on the cluster. If you are having problems during your installation, submit a [help request on the RC Portal](https://portal.rc.fas.harvard.edu/rcrt/submit_ticket) or stop by [Office Hours](https://www.rc.fas.harvard.edu/training/office-hours/).
