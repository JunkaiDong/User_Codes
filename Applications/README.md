## Installation of Scientific Software

Installation instructions for multiple scientific applications
including Bioinformatics, Computational Chemistry, and Climate
Modeling on the cluster. Corresponding folders contain example scripts
to execute these applications on the cluster after successful
installation.

### Contents:

* [AlphaFold](AlphaFold): Instructions to install and run AlphaFold on
  the cluster.
* [CryoSPARC](CryoSPARC): Instructions to install and run CryoSPARC on
  the cluster.
* [Dynamite](Dynamite): Instructions to set up and execute Dynamite on
  the cluster.
* [Knitro](Knitro): Examples to use Knitro with Matlab, Python, and C
  on the cluster.
* [LANDIS](LANDIS): Instructions to either install LANDIS or use its
  singularity image and run it on the cluster.
* [PariGP](PariGP): Instructions to load PariGP's module on the
  cluster and example scritps to execute it.
* [Schrodinger](Schrodinger): Instructions to run Schrodinger on the
