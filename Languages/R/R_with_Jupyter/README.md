# R in Jupyter

## Purpose

This documemntation explains how to use R in a Jupyter Notebook

## Requirements

Refer to steps 1-4 in [R in
Jupyter](https://docs.rc.fas.harvard.edu/kb/r-and-rstudio/) to install package
[`r2py`](https://rpy2.github.io/) in a conda/mamba environment and launch a
Jupyter Notebook.

## Install R Packages in Jupyter

One can install R packages directly in a Jupyter notebook using rpy2's
`utils` feature. 

A sample notebook, [`rpy2-test.ipynb`](rpy2-test.ipynb), has been provided here
to demonstrate package installation using the `utils` feature.
