### What is R?

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a [GNU project](https://www.gnu.org/) which is similar to the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. R can be considered as a different implementation of S. There are some important differences, but much code written for S runs unaltered under R.

To get started with R on the Harvard University FAS cluster you can try the below examples:

* [Example 1](Example1): Print out integers from 10 down to 1
