### What is Matlab?

[MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) is a high-performance language for technical computing. It integrates computation, visualization, and programming in an easy-to-use environment where problems and solutions are expressed in familiar mathematical notation. MATLAB features a family of add-on application-specific solutions called toolboxes. Toolboxes are comprehensive collections of MATLAB functions (M-files) that extend the MATLAB environment to solve particular classes of problems.

The name MATLAB stands for a matrix laboratory. MATLAB was originally written to provide easy access to matrix software developed by the LINPACK and EISPACK projects. Today, MATLAB engines incorporate the LAPACK and BLAS libraries, embedding the state of the art in software for matrix computation.

To get started with Matlab on the FAS cluster you can try the below examples:

* [Example1](Example1/): Monte-Carlo computation of PI
* [Example2](Example2/): Sums up integers from 1 to N 
* [Example3](Example3/): Generates a multi-figure on a 3 X 3 grid
* [Example4](Example4/): Illustration of job arrays and parameter sweeps
* [Example5](Example5/): Random vectors and job arrays
